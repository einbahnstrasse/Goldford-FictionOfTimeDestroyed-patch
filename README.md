# Goldford-FictionOfTimeDestroyed-patches

## The Fiction of Time Destroyed — Performance Patch

Louis Goldford (2015), patch rev. 2016 for ICMC, Utrecht

### Installation   

Download & unzip folder “Goldford-FictionOfTimeDestroyed-patches” and place in your Max packages folder (Applications/Max 8/Packages) or elsewhere in your Max search path.


### Requirements    

In order to run the software in performance, you will need IRCAMverb from the IRCAM forum (http://forumnet.ircam.fr/). Without IRCAMverb, onboard reverb may be substituted at mix position.

It is strongly advised that a small USB/MIDI mixer be used to control the faders in the patch, but one can also use the mouse when necessary. The patch is configured for a Korg nanoKONTROL2.

See the SCORE (Goldford-TheFictionOfTimeDestroyed-FSD7.pdf), located in the patch folder, for additional setup requirements.


### Running    

Before attempting to run the piece, review the tech rider (Fiction-TechRider-InterfaceInstructions.pdf) which also includes an introduction to the patch’s interface as well as mappings for the nanoKONTROL2.

1. Click on Goldford-FictionOfTimeDestroyed-MAIN-03.maxpat, from the main folder, to launch the patch. 
2. Test and set levels for the 3 instrument mics, the soundfile playback level, reverb, main outputs, and dry levels.
3. Click on the “init!” button once all audio drivers and mics are configured. 
4. Conductor cues the start of the piece, and computer assistant follows throughout.


### Updates    

10.16.16 —
1. Score PDF updated to version “Goldford-TheFictionOfTimeDestroyed-FSD7.pdf”.
2. Main patch updated to include JUMP CUEING to facilitate rehearsals. Qlist’s rewind problem has been solved. Now the user may launch an individual cue mid-piece (from the “p cuez” subpatch) without launching the cues that came before it. (This has only been tested on a few cues, however; there may be further problems due to preloading a sound file a cue earlier, prior to launching that sound file’s cue. If this becomes a problem I will need to redesign the Qlist to reflect this.)
